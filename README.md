# US-GDP-Forecasting-Time-Series-Auto-ARIMA-Model
Welcome to the US GDP Forecasting project, where we delve into a comprehensive analysis and forecasting of the quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States from 2003 to 2022. Our focus lies in forecasting quarterly GDP values using a range of time series models, including ARIMA, Holt-Winters, Auto-regressive, and Moving Average. Our ultimate goal was to develop an accurate model that predicts future GDP values based on historical trends.

# Project Highlights:
- Forecasting quarterly US GDP values using diverse time series models.
- Evaluation of model performance using MAPE and RMSE metrics.
- Identification of the Auto ARIMA model as the optimal fit for the data.
-Prediction of future GDP values for the upcoming four quarters.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for individuals keen on understanding and implementing time series analytics for economic forecasting. Explore our code, insights, and methodologies to gain a deeper understanding of US GDP trends and effective forecasting techniques.
